# ScapeCloud
ScapeCloud is an image upload service for Old School RuneScape. Instead of users images being saved to their local machine, they are uploaded to the cloud ready to be shared. We utilize metadata from the client to provide extra functionality about the image such as: Combat Level, Nearby Players, Total Level, Player Name, Account Type (Ironman), and more.
